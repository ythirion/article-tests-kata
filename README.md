# Unit Testing
You are developing using a `test last` approach.

Add those tests on the `sut` called `Article`:

- Ensures that a comment can be added to an article
- Checks that a comment can be added to an article that already contains a comment.
- Ensures that adding an existing comment to an article fails.
